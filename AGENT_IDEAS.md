# 💡 ADK-TS Agent Ideas

A list of agent ideas for the adk-ts-samples repo. Each represents a real-world use case showcasing different ways to build with ADK-TS — from simple tool-based agents to complex multi-agent systems.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Status Tracking: When you start working on an agent, please update the Status field from "Available" to "WIP - @github_username" to avoid duplicate work. When completed, change it to "Built". This helps coordinate efforts across the team

**Before Submitting a Project**: We're looking to maintain a balanced portfolio that demonstrates the full range of ADK-TS capabilities. Each new project should have a real-world use case and help us balance across:

- Skill levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- Domains (Web2, Web3, and general applications)
- Agent patterns (Tool-based, Multi-tool, Multi-agent systems)

Make sure your project fills a gap and showcases a unique way to use ADK-TS
