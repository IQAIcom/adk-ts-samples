- 📊 **Intelligent Transaction Classification**: Automatically categorizes transactions (BUY, SELL, SWAP, INCOME, etc.)
- 💰 **Cost Basis Calculation**: Supports FIFO, LIFO, and HIFO accounting methods
- 📄 **Tax Report Generation**: Creates reports in IRS Form 8949, CSV, and summary formats
- ⏰ **Time-Period Filtering**: Filter transactions by year or custom date ranges
- 🧠 **Natural Language Understanding**: Query transactions and reports conversationally
- 📈 **Built on ADK-TS**: Built with ADK-TS for reliable AI interactions

## Architecture and Workflow

This project demonstrates a complete crypto tax analysis workflow with specialized tools:

1. **Crypto Tax Agent** - Main coordinator that orchestrates the tax analysis workflow
2. **Transaction Fetcher** - Retrieves on-chain transactions from blockchain explorers
3. **Transaction Classifier** - Categorizes transactions by tax event type
4. **Cost Basis Calculator** - Computes capital gains/losses using accounting methods
5. **Report Generator** - Creates tax reports in various formats

## Usage Examples

The agent handles complete crypto tax workflows through natural language queries. Here's a sample interaction:

```text
👤 User: Hi! I need to calculate my crypto taxes for 2024.
🤖 Agent: Hello! I can help you with crypto tax analysis. I support:
         • Multi-chain transaction fetching (Ethereum, Base, Fraxtal)
         • Tax event classification (buys, sells, swaps, income)
         • Cost basis calculation (FIFO, LIFO, HIFO methods)
         • Tax report generation

         What would you like to do?

👤 User: Fetch my transactions from wallet 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb on Ethereum for 2024
🤖 Agent: [Fetches transactions via Etherscan API]
         ✅ Found 47 transactions for 2024

👤 User: Now classify these transactions for tax purposes
🤖 Agent: [Classifies transactions]
         ✅ Classification complete:
         • 12 BUY transactions (cost basis events)
         • 8 SELL transactions (taxable events)
         • 15 SWAP transactions (capital gains)
         • 5 INCOME transactions (airdrops/staking)
         • 7 Other transactions

👤 User: Calculate capital gains using FIFO method
🤖 Agent: [Calculates gains]
         ✅ Capital Gains Summary (FIFO):
         • Short-term gains: $2,450.32
         • Long-term gains: $8,120.65
         • Losses: ($1,230.15)
         • Net gains: $9,340.82

👤 User: Generate an IRS Form 8949 report
🤖 Agent: [Generates report]
         ✅ Report generated and ready for download
```

**Example Queries:**

- "Fetch my transactions from wallet 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb on Ethereum for 2024"
- "Classify my transactions for tax purposes"
- "Calculate capital gains using LIFO method"
- "Generate a detailed tax report with Form 8949 format"
- "Generate a summary report showing totals"
- "Export results as CSV"
- "What's my total capital gains for 2024?"

## Real-World Use Cases

The **fetch → classify → calculate → report** pipeline in this project maps to many financial analysis workflows. Here are examples of what you can build by extending this agent:

### DeFi Yield Tracker

Swap the tax classification logic for yield-tracking rules. The agent fetches staking, lending, and LP positions, classifies reward types (interest, farming rewards, rebases), calculates annualized yields, and generates a consolidated income report.

### Multi-Wallet Portfolio Reconciler

Extend the transaction fetcher to aggregate across multiple wallets and chains. The classifier groups transactions by asset, the calculator tracks cost basis across wallets, and the reporter produces a unified portfolio view with per-wallet breakdowns.

### Airdrop & Income Auditor

Focus the pipeline on income events — airdrops, staking rewards, referral bonuses, and governance token distributions. The agent classifies each event, looks up fair market value at the time of receipt, and generates an income schedule ready for tax filing.

### How to Adapt This Pipeline

The core pattern generalizes to any financial analysis domain:

| Pipeline Step  | What to Customize                                     | Example                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fetcher**    | Add data sources (more chains, CEX APIs, CSV imports) | Import Coinbase/Binance trade history via API                   |
| **Classifier** | Change classification rules for your domain           | Detect LP deposits/withdrawals as non-taxable transfers         |
| **Calculator** | Swap accounting logic (average cost, specific ID)     | Add average cost basis method for jurisdictions that require it |
| **Reporter**   | Modify output format and jurisdiction rules           | Generate UK HMRC-compatible reports instead of IRS Form 8949    |

You can also **add steps** — insert a deduplication stage between fetcher and classifier, or add a tax-loss harvesting recommender after the calculator.

## Tax Methods Explained

### FIFO (First In, First Out)

- **Description**: Assumes oldest assets are sold first
- **Use Case**: Most common method, easier to track
- **Result**: Higher capital gains in bull markets

### LIFO (Last In, First Out)

- **Description**: Assumes newest assets are sold first
- **Use Case**: Can reduce taxes if recent purchases were expensive
- **Result**: Lower gains if recent purchases were at higher prices

### HIFO (Highest In, First Out)

- **Description**: Matches sales with highest-cost acquisitions first
- **Use Case**: Tax optimization strategy
- **Result**: Minimizes capital gains

## Capital Gains Classification

### Short-Term Capital Gains

- Assets held ≤ 365 days
- Taxed as ordinary income
- Rates vary by income level (10-37%)

### Long-Term Capital Gains

- Assets held > 365 days
- Preferential tax rates (0%, 15%, or 20%)
- More favorable than short-term

### Income Events

- Staking rewards, airdrops, mining rewards
- Taxed as ordinary income at fair market value received
- Creates cost basis for future disposals

## Known Limitations

This is a **sample implementation** designed for educational purposes. Known limitations:

- ⚠️ **Basic Transaction Classification**: Uses simple heuristics (from/to address matching) - doesn't detect DEX swaps, smart contract interactions, or complex DeFi transactions
- ⚠️ **Price Data**: Uses CoinGecko API when available, falls back to mock prices
- ⚠️ **No Persistence**: Session-based only, no database storage for multi-session state
- ⚠️ **EVM Chains Only**: Ethereum, Base, Fraxtal - no Bitcoin, Solana, or other blockchains
- ⚠️ **No Advanced Tax Features**:
  - No wash sale rule detection
  - No DeFi protocol tracking (lending, liquidity pools)
  - No NFT or smart contract interaction detection
  - No margin trading or derivatives
  - Limited to individual address analysis (no multi-wallet aggregation)
  - No cost allocation for partial fills

## Areas for Improvement

- Real-time price data integration
- Enhanced DeFi protocol support
- Multi-wallet portfolio tracking
- Tax optimization suggestions
- Export formats for popular tax software (TurboTax, TaxAct, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Etherscan API errors**: Ensure ETHERSCAN_API_KEY is valid and has not exceeded rate limits
- **Missing price data**: CoinGecko API may have rate limits; falls back to mock prices
- **Transaction classification errors**: Complex DeFi transactions may be classified as UNKNOWN
- **Google AI errors**: Ensure GOOGLE_API_KEY is valid and has sufficient quota
- **Empty transaction lists**: Verify wallet address format and chain selection
